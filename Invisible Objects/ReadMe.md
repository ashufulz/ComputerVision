Hello folks.

You must have seen Harry Potter movies, right?
I have watched it so many times that I can't even remember.

As Harry used his Invisibility Cloak to hide beneath it and roam around the castle, I have tried to make the same thing.
In this project I made an object invisible through Computer Vision techniques and Python programming.

Hope you like it.

Regards,
AF



PS - I am no way the sole owner of the code. I have just tried to imitate some random similar YouTube tutorial.
Peace out!
